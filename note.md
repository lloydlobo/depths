# note

## scratch

- [ ] Avoid NPCs from colliding with blocks/drillroom/etc..)
- [ ] Do not overwrite existing hiscore if current is less
- [ ] Find out where player touched the box
- [ ] Floor color changes on contact // like piano tiles
- [ ] If player dead or health==0.. allow retry option or make it new game for that level id OR delete the level file
- [ ] Implement drillroom save/load functions (data and filenames)
- [ ] Make the transactiom on "Make Resource" for every 25 copper -> convert them to get a new pearl/iron
- [ ] Move this in package player (if possible)
- [ ] Package drillroom only makes sense if player has a limited cargo capacity
- [ ] Slide/Y-axis-barrier
- [ ] Use a global Uberstruct/Mega game struct -> Unify for ease of sharing function signatures
- [ ] Use omit empty json struct tag
