The game is nowhere near completion, although it has a small demo, to showcase
a fraction of the core idea.

It's a little prototype I made, while trying on 3D game programming for the first time.

Used Raylib with Go [raylib-go bindings](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) to put this together.
NOTE: Compilation requires raylib-go, and other dependencies.

This game's theme is a heavily inspired adaptation of [Dig and Delve](https://annekatran.itch.io/dig-and-delve).

Thanks to all the artists of the wonderful music included, and to Kenney for the amazing assets
